# Node + React + JWT Authentication and Authorization!

I have made this app to familiarize myself with the workings of JWT and how to implement it on both client side and server side.

Features :-
- User can create their own login credentials and __SignUp__
- The password that the user will provide will be __hashed__ and it will not be visible in the database.
- User can __SignIn__ into their particular account and view their credentials.
- User can __SignOut__ of their accounts.
- The current user will only have access to the __Protected API Route__ if they are __SignedIn__.
